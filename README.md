# Habits
Habits is a user-friendly, offline iOS application designed to help users build and track their daily habits
effectively. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, Habits enables users to create new habits and monitor 
their progress as they work toward personal goals. The app encourages a structured approach, allowing users 
to follow habits in a specific sequence, which is ideal for routines that require order, such as morning or 
evening routines.
